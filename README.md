# ‚ö°Ô∏è react-native-jsi-crypto

A fast implementation of Node's `crypto` module written in C/C++ JSI.

JSICrypto can be used as a drop-in replacement for your Web3/Crypto apps to speed up all cryptography functions.

For example, creating a Wallet using ethers.js uses complex algorithms to generate a private-key/mnemonic-phrase pair:

```ts
const start = performance.now()
const wallet = ethers.Wallet.createRandom()
const end = performance.now()
console.log(`Creating a Wallet took ${end - start}ms.`)
```

**Without** react-native-jsi-crypto üê¢:

```
Creating a Wallet took 31.3582738422ms
```

**With** react-native-jsi-crypto ‚ö°Ô∏è:

```
Creating a Wallet took 2.47425001859ms
```

## Installation

### React Native

```sh
yarn add react-native-jsi-crypto
cd ios && pod install
```

### Expo

```sh
expo install react-native-jsi-crypto
expo prebuild
```

## Usage

In your `metro.config.js`, add a module resolver to replace `crypto` with `react-native-jsi-crypto`:

```diff
+const path = require('path');

 module.exports = {
+  resolver: {
+    extraNodeModules: {
+      crypto: path.resolve(__dirname, './node_modules/react-native-jsi-crypto'),
+    },
+  },
   ...
```

Now, all imports for `crypto` will be resolved as `react-native-jsi-crypto` instead.

## Limitations

As the library uses JSI for synchronous native methods access, remote debugging (e.g. with Chrome) is no longer possible. Instead, you should use [Flipper](https://fbflipper.com).
